All of the objects in our array are of the same *type* in that there is nothing special about them. In general, curly brackets in `Bash` are used to group things together and the square brackets are used to index something.  We can use the `@` symbol as an index to list all of the entries out, which we are going to need for the `for` loop. As shown below the `for` is pretty boiler plate compared to other scripting langauges; however the `if` statement is a bit different. Notice that there is whitespace padded inside of the square brackets. Removing this space *will* produce an error. This is one of those times where whitespace makes a difference. Furthermore, the test for equality is performed using a single `=` symbol, which is different than most other programming languages.

      "In this section, we are going to look at a couple of commands that use [regular expressions](http://xkcd.com/1171/), or regex for short. The first command we want to look at is `grep`. The `grep` utility searches any given input files, selecting lines that match one or more patterns. We can do many more operation with `grep`; however, just printing out certian lines of a file is powerful enough own its own because it can lead to further manipulation. Lets come back to `eesi-names.txt` and print out only the lines at start with the pattern `G` ('^' is used to denote the start of a line in the expression -- `$` is used for the end of a line)."

For example, lets find any occurance of `Gregory` and replace it with `Greg` in `eesi-names.txt`. Have a close look at how we are calling `sed` in the example below."

Therefore, we will use `sh` to denote that the script is a shell script. Finally, we are going to add `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to the top of every file.
